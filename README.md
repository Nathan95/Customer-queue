# Customer-queue

To view this file you first need to:

1. Create a database called contacts and name the table contacts as well.
2. I've attached an sql file with data to import into the database.

I've created a simple queue system using OOP and javascript on a MVC platform. I chose mvc because its secure and protects you from sql injections. MVC offers you a more cleaner and structured way of writing php.
